# Uber-Data-Analysis
The Uber Analytics Dashboard project was a comprehensive analytics solution developed using Python, SQL, Jupyter Notebook, Mage, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The goal of this project was to build an end-to-end analytics pipeline that encompassed data ingestion, transformation, and visualization to provide real-time insights into Uber's data. The dashboard can be viewed [here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/9d7a57fe-0377-44fe-8c54-75b843444b16).
